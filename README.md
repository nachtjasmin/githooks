# githooks

Several hooks I am using together with [lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook).
Feel free to use them in your projects.

## Usage

To use all of the checks, use the following snippet in your `lefthook.yml`:

```yaml
remote:
  git_url: git@github.com:nachtjasmin/githooks

# Optionally, you can limit it to one of the files in here:
# config: <name of the .yml file>, by default all hooks are chosen
```
